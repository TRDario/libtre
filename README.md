# libtre
libtre is a personal C++ library for game engine fundamentals.

## Examples

(Coming soon...)

## State of Development

libtre is currently still in active development. There may and probably will be bugs and API breakage, and I can't guarantee any stability just yet.

Since this is primarily a personal project right now, I intend to do version freezes in service of my projects rather than with any concrete roadmap or schedule.

## Documentation

Documentation can be built with Doxygen, or can be viewed [here](https://trdario.github.io/libtre/).

The HTML theme uses [Doxygen Awesome](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css).

- A C++20 compiler.
